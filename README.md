## 🌟 About The Project

**Interview Prep AI** is a full-stack web application built to streamline and enhance the technical interview preparation process. Traditional methods of interview prep often involve sifting through generic lists of questions that may not be relevant to a specific role or experience level. This application solves that problem by leveraging the power of **Google's Gemini AI** to generate highly targeted content.

Users can create personalized study sessions based on their target job role, years of experience, and specific technical topics they wish to focus on. The AI then generates a curated list of questions and detailed answers, providing a solid foundation for practice. More than just a Q&A tool, it allows users to dive deeper into any concept with AI-powered explanations, pin crucial questions, and add personal notes, creating a comprehensive and customized learning environment.

### Environment Variables

Before running the backend, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and add the following:

```env
# MongoDB Connection String
MONGO_URI=<YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>

# JSON Web Token Secret
JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>

# Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>

# Port for the server (optional, defaults to 5000)
PORT=5000
```
